# Foreword

Welcome to our Code Handbook! This handbook is here to help us stay aligned as we work together on our project. It’s designed to keep our code style and techniques consistent, so everyone’s work is easy to read, understand, and build on.

Inside, you’ll find examples, tips, and guidelines that make it easier for us to code in sync. By following the same patterns and practices, we can avoid confusion, save time, and ensure our project stays organized and maintainable as it grows.

Let’s keep this handbook open for updates and ideas from everyone—it’s a tool we’re building together to support our success!
