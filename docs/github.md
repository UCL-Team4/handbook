# Github

This page goes over the best practices on how we use github to manage our project and workflow.

## Semantic Commit Messages
We use semantic commit messages to keep our commit history clean, organized, and easy to understand. This helps us quickly identify what each commit does, track down issues, and generate meaningful release notes.

### Commit Message Format
A semantic commit message follows this format:
```php
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

#### Type: The type of change being made (e.g., feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore).
#### Scope (optional): The scope of the change (e.g., variable name, file, module, feature).
#### Description: A short description of the change.


### Examples
Here are some examples of semantic commit messages:
```php
feat(cart): add functionality to apply discount codes
fix(login): resolve session timeout issue on login page
docs(readme): update setup instructions for developers
style(product-list): format product cards for mobile view
refactor(api): simplify order processing logic for scalability
test(user): add unit tests for user registration process
chore(env): configure dotenv for environment variables
```
